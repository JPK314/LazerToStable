# LazerToStable

A working converter from file format v128 (current lazer) to file format v14 (stable). Place your .osu file(s) you want to convert into the folder with main.py, and run with
```
python -m src.main
```
on the command line from the folder containing the README.

TODO: hitsound conversions. Does anyone know how this part works?
